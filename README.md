# Ichō
Ichō is a collaborative dictionaries development tool. It is meant to provide an easy way for people to document their under-represented languages. Presently, many people are using Toolbox, which works fine but isn't as intuitive for some people as it could be. Ichō is meant to be an easier-to-teach alternative for people in remote areas who'd like to do the work but lack the training.

## Features
Internet access is often poorest in the areas most in need of language documentation. Offline-first but online-ready, Ichō allows easy collaboration by synching your work when internet access is available. 

In production versions, the UI will be made as straightforward as possible. After years of developing [Phonemica](http://phonemica.net), we appreciate perhaps more than most how differently different people interact with computers, and what is intuitive in Chicago might not be in Chengdu.

Ichō is built on Node and distributed with Electron and will work equally well on Linux, Windows or macOS. And with automatic updates, Ichō keeps itself up to date without regular large downloads on unreliable mobile tethering connections.

## Release

Ichō is still in development. It will be undergoing usability testing in January. Once we're sure it's stable and works as it should on a wide range of hardware, we'll share the details of how to get a copy of your own.
